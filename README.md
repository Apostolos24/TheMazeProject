# The Maze Project

## Introduction
This project was an idea that came to my mind one day and decided to implement it as it seemed fun and a good way to practice and delve deeper in C++ and pathfinding algorithms especially.

## What is it about?
The Maze Project, as the name suggests, is a programm that will generate a random maze with a start and end point on which an array of pathfinding algorithms will be tested upon. These algorithms will be tasked with finding the shortest (or any) path from start to end. The goal is for the algorithms to be tested on a bunch of randomly generated mazes and then compare their overall results.

## Can you tell us a bit more?
