# The Maze Project

## Introduction
This project was an idea that came to my mind one day and decided to implement it as it seemed fun and a good way to practice and delve deeper in C++ and pathfinding algorithms especially.

## What is it about?
The Maze Project, as the name suggests, is a programm that will generate a random maze with a start and end point on which an array of pathfinding algorithms will be tested upon. These algorithms will be tasked with finding the shortest (or any) path from start to end. The goal is for the algorithms to be tested on a bunch of randomly generated mazes and then compare their overall results.

## Can you tell us a bit more?
So that was the main idea, or at least how I imagined it when I came up with it. 
All the code will be written in C++, the language I am most fluent with. 
For now and the near future this project will be entirely in the terminal. This is because the focus of the project is getting better at developing with C++ and trying to implement pathfinding algorithms, rather than designing a full blown application. This will be the case at least until I develop the first stable build. After that, I will consider ditching the terminal and trying to display the whole thing with graphics, as I want to learn SDL2 and game design in general.
Another goal is the ability to see real time the algorithms running and seeing wich paths they choose and what decisions they make. The idea is that a person will be able to execute the algorithm move by move and see it traverse the maze, that way gaining a better understanding of how these algorithms operate and in a more fun way.
In the (very) distant future I might also try to take the data collected from all the algorithms and proccess them with Python as to gain better experience and build on to my (admittedly limited to theory) Data Science knowledge.
